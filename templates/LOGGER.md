The chaos strategy is a strategy of software development based on the chaos model. The main rule is always resolve the most important issue first.
An issue is an incomplete programming task.
The most important issue is a combination of big, urgent, and robust.
Big issues provide value to users as working functionality.
Urgent issues are timely in that they would otherwise hold up other work.
Robust issues are trusted and tested. Developers can then safely focus their attention elsewhere.
To resolve means to bring it to a point of stability.
