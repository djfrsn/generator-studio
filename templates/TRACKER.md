Is the flexbox model already used in production? I thought using flexbox in real-world Websites is still far away?

@kaspar, we are lucky enough to only have to support iOS, Android, Windows 8 (IE10) and Firefox. All of which at least support the display: box; spec. If you are supporting IE 7, 8 or 9 you will have to gracefully degrade, or find an alternative. I believe there are also JavaScript polyfills that can fill the Flexbox gaps too.
